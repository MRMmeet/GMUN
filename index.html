		<span>GMUN stands for Global Model United Nations. It is an educational simulation and academic activity that aims to replicate the workings of the real United Nations (UN). In a GMUN conference, participants, often students from various educational institutions, represent different countries and act as delegates to address complex global issues, debate policies, negotiate, and find solutions to global challenges.<br>

During a GMUN conference, participants are assigned to different committees or specialized agencies that mirror the various UN bodies, such as the General Assembly, Security Council, Human Rights Council, Economic and Social Council, and others. Each committee discusses specific topics related to international relations, diplomacy, peacekeeping, development, human rights, and more.<br>

The main objectives of a GMUN conference include promoting understanding of international affairs, fostering diplomatic skills, enhancing public speaking and negotiation abilities, and encouraging teamwork and critical thinking. Participants gain insights into the complexities of global issues, learn about different countries' perspectives, and experience the challenges of international diplomacy and cooperation.<br></span></div>
